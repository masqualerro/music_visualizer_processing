Music player and visualizer written in Processing using the Minim library

Inspired by early 2000s iTunes music player visualizers.

App generates rectangular or ellipse patterns based on the waveform + bpm of the chosen song. User can customize the stroke color and desired shape of the visualizer pattern. User has the option to cycle between 5 different songs.

USER CONTROLS:
** also outlined in app **
-- 1-5 keys cycle between 5 different song options (each key corresponds to a different song)
-- a-e keys control play functionality for each song -- a will play "1", b will play "2" etc.
-- "u" key selects ellipse visualizer
-- "v" key selects rectangular visualizer
-- w-z keys cycle through various stroke color options
-- SPACE key will stop playback

Visualizer designed and written by me, GUI made with Alessandra Vargas.
